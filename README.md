# Marvel Heroes Project by Cgc

Hi, I'm Carlos and I've done this little project.
These are the technologies I've used:
- Angular 19.0.2
- Node.js 22.11.0
- Angular Material for Web Components
- Echarts.js for graphics (https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)

The project consists of: 
- CRUD of Marvel heroes provided by Wikipedia.
- Lookup table of all records.
- Wizard to create.
- Modal component for editing and/or querying.
- Bar chart and pie chart to represent totalities filtered by creator, country of origin, skills etc.
- Chip component to filter heroes in the table, adding and removing 'live-action'.
- Persistent data, when refreshing the browser the data persists despite not having a real database.

Hope you like it!

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
